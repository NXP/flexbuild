When the application is started, Linux enters suspend mode, and users must enter the timeout value in Cortex-M33 console. Then Cortex-M33 records one second audio input from MIC array on the i.MX 93 EVK board, and try to identify whether there is baby crying or glass breaking sound in the audio by running ML model inference. If baby crying or glass breaking sound is detected, it will wake up Cortex-A55 core and send the result to Linux through rpmsg-tty. If baby crying or glass breaking sound is not detected, it will suspend Cortex-M33 core for the configured timeout and wake up Cortex-M33 core to record one second audio again, and run the same process in an infinite loop until a baby crying or glass breaking sound is detected. An internet connection is required."
